# Microsoft Dev Box accelerator: Dev Center Configuration
# ======================================
#
# Purpose: Defines the Dev Center resource and associated projects for Microsoft Dev Box accelerator.
# This configuration establishes a centralized developer workstation platform with
# role-specific configurations and appropriate access controls.

# Each project has its own Dev Box configurations, catalogs, and permissions
# Best practice: Create separate projects for different teams or workstreams
