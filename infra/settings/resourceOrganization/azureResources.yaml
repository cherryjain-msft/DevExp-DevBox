# Microsoft Dev Box accelerator: Resource Groups Configuration
# =======================================================
#
# Purpose: Defines the resource group organization structure for environments.
# This configuration aligns with Azure Landing Zone principles by segregating resources
# based on their functional purpose (workload, security, monitoring, connectivity).

# Workload Resource Group
# -----------------------
# Purpose: Contains the primary Dev Box workload resources including:
# - Dev Center resources
# - Dev Box definitions
# - Dev Box pools
# - Project resources
#
# Best practice: Separate application workloads from infrastructure components
# to enable independent scaling, access control, and lifecycle management.

# ----------------------
# Purpose: Contains security-related resources including:
# - Key Vaults for secret management
# - Microsoft Defender for Cloud configurations
# - Network Security Groups
# - Private endpoints
#
# Best practice: Isolate security resources to apply stricter access controls
# and enable separate monitoring/auditing of security components.
