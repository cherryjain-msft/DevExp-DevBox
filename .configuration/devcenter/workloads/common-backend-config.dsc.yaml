#
# Backend Development Configuration Sample for .NET Engineers 
# =============================================
#
# Purpose:
#   This DSC configuration installs essential tools for Azure backend development including:
#   - Source control tools (GitHub Desktop)
#   - Azure command-line tools (CLI, AZD, Bicep)
#   - Local development emulators for Azure services
#
# Best Practices:
#   - All tools are installed via WinGet for consistent versioning
#   - Dependencies are explicitly declared to ensure proper installation order
#   - Tools are grouped logically by purpose
#   - Configuration should be version controlled and tested in CI/CD pipelines
#   - Regular updates to ensure latest security patches and features
#   - Separation of development tools from production configurations
#

    # Azure Command-Line Tools
    #----------------------------------------------
    # Resource: Azure CLI
    # Azure CLI is the foundation for Azure management and serves as a dependency for other Azure tools.
    # It provides command-line access to nearly all Azure service operations.
    #
    # Key Azure integration points:
    # - Unified authentication with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
    # - Support for service principals and managed identities
    # - JSON-based output for automation and scripting
    # - Cross-platform compatibility for consistent workflows
    #
    # Security best practices:
    # - Use 'az login --tenant' to explicitly specify tenants
    # - Leverage managed identities where available
    # - Apply RBAC with principle of least privilege
    # - Use service principals with certificate-based auth for automation
    # - Regularly update CLI using 'az upgrade' command
    # - Avoid storing credentials in CLI cache in shared environments
    # - Configure CLI to use your organization's approved proxy if required
    #
    # Common development scenarios:
    # - Resource provisioning via templates and scripts
    # - Querying resource status and configurations
    # - Integrated deployment workflows with CI/CD
    # - Management of secrets and connection strings
    #
    # DSC-specific notes:
    # - WinGet ensures automatic updates to secure versions
    # - Installation is idempotent and will not reinstall if present
    # - Consider adding environment PATH validation during configuration testing
