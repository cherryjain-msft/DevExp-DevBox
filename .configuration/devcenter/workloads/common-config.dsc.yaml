    #----------------------------------------------
    # Storage Configuration
    #----------------------------------------------
    # Resource: Dev Drive
    # Dev Drive provides optimized filesystem performance for development workloads
    # with ReFS features like integrity streams and block cloning for Git operations.
    # 
    # Key benefits for Azure development:
    # - Significantly faster Git operations for large Azure repositories
    # - Improved file system performance for build operations
    # - ReFS block cloning accelerates Docker container operations
    # - Optimized for large solution files common in Azure microservice architectures

    #----------------------------------------------
    # Source Control Tools
    #----------------------------------------------
    # Resource: Git
    # Git is essential for Microsoft Dev Box landing zone accelerator workflows, enabling developers to work with
    # source code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code.
    #
    # Azure-specific considerations:
    # - Supports Azure DevOps repositories and GitHub integration
    # - Required for Azure Bicep template development and versioning
    # - Enables GitOps workflows with Azure Arc and Azure Kubernetes Service
    # - Optimized when used with Dev Drive for performance
    #
    # Will be used by:
    # - Azure CLI when working with Azure Repos
    # - GitHub CLI for GitHub-hosted Azure projects
    # - Azure Developer CLI (azd) for project templates

    # Resource: GitHub CLI
    # GitHub CLI streamlines GitHub workflow automation directly from the terminal,
    # enabling efficient Azure DevOps integration and GitHub Actions management.
    #
    # Azure-specific benefits:
    # - Manage GitHub repositories that host Azure infrastructure code
    # - Create and manage GitHub Actions workflows for Azure deployments
    # - Work with GitHub issues and pull requests for Azure service development
    # - Authenticate to GitHub Container Registry for Azure container deployments
    #
    # Security note:
    # - Authentication tokens are stored securely in Windows Credential Manager

    # Resource: .NET Runtime 9
    # The .NET Runtime enables execution of .NET applications and is required
    # for running Azure tooling that depends on .NET.
    #
    # Azure-specific considerations:
    # - Required by many Azure command-line tools (Azure PowerShell, etc.)
    # - Supports running Azure Functions core tools locally
    # - Needed for Azure Storage Emulator and other local emulators
    # - Enables testing of containerized .NET applications before Azure deployment
